# autogen-workflow

AgentForge is a modular LLM workflow engine based on AutoGen, enabling interactive, human-in-the-loop pipelines for complex writing tasks.
It allows users to input custom prompts, upload documents, select from multiple LLMs, and build end-to-end flows like content expansion, error detection, correction, and validation â€” all with transparent intermediate results and full manual control.

Designed for extensibility, AgentForge supports future workflows across writing, QA, code review, content moderation, and beyond.
